# 🕵️ Universal Market Research Tool

This project is an automated OSINT tool designed to scout B2B leads using AI agents.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **User Interface:** A custom HTML dashboard sends a research topic to n8n.
2. **AI Agent:** Perplexity AI (`sonar-pro`) scouts the web for real-time data.
3. **Database:** Results are automatically cleaned and saved to Google Sheets.
